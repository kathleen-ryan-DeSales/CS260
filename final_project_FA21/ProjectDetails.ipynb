    "The final project for this class will invovle an analysis on a dataset of your team's own choosing. You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The intent of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main goal is to prove to me that:\n",
    "* you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with the results of basic data analysis and visualization, \n",
    "* you are proficient in using Python, \n",
    "* you are proficient at interpreting results, and \n",
    "* you are able to tell a cohesive story when you present your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is very open ended. You should create compelling visualizations of this data in Python and then interpret them. (You can even use statistical techniques or visualizations we haven’t officially covered in class, if you’re feeling adventurous.)  There is no limit on what tools or packages you may incorporate, but you must also incorporate packages we learned in class. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A handful of high quality visualizations that tell a compelling story will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations that are unrelated to each other. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, grammar, cohesiveness, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in Jupyter Lab/Notebooks, using Python."
