    "The final project for this class will invovle an analysis on a dataset of your team's own choosing. You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The intent of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main goal is to prove to me that:\n",
    "* you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with the results of basic data analysis and visualization, \n",
    "* you are proficient in using Python, \n",
    "* you are proficient at interpreting visualizations, and \n",
    "* you are able to tell a cohesive story when you present your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is very open-ended. You should create compelling visualizations of your data in Python and then interpret them. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may incorporate, but you must incorporate packages and techniques we learned in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You should expect to incorporate visualizations that we have used in class and at least one that we have not (like violin graphs, heat maps, etc) because with your Python knowledge togther with a google search for examples, you have the ability to accomplish this. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You should also use statistical technniques from class (mean, standard deviation, typical vs. non typical intervals, correlation coefficient, percentiles).  Of course, if you feel comfortable with stats, you can even use more advanced statistical techniques such as regression lines and t-tests or z-tests.  Just talk to me about the results you're finding so we can make sure they are legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. **A handful of high quality visualizations that tell a compelling story will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations that are unrelated to each other.**\n",

    "Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, grammar, cohesiveness, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in Google Colab, using Python."

    "Ideally, your data set should be in an excel file or a csv file or some type of table that can be converted to these files. If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into Ptyhon as this can be tricky depending on the source.

    "Presentations will take place during the final exam period.  The presentation should last 8-10 minutes, with points taken off for speaking too long or too short.  There will be 5 minutes after each talk for questions and for transitioning to the next team.  If you go over 10 minutes during your presentation, I will have to interrupt/stop your presentaton as otherwise, not everyone will need a chance to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:  Each team member should say something substantial and speak for a decent amount of time.   Also, it should be clear that your team practiced together. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you give your final presentation, the audience should clearly understand the point of your research question.  Also, the relevance of each visualization/statistic to your question should be clear.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation should be cohesive and have a natural flow.  **So your presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (\"We did this, then we did this, etc.\").  Instead, it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.** \n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense that your presentation should include these items:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* your research question \n",
    "* an explanation of the context/domain: Make your topic accessible.  For example, if analyzing hockey data, do not assume that everyone in the audience understands hockey jargon or the rules of hockey.  Tell the audience what they need to know to understand your project.\n",
    "* an explanation of the variables\n",
    "* explanation of your results/conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of your presentation, you should include these 2 slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Future Work Slide - The second to last slide should be entitled \"Future Work\". Here, give ideas for what you would work on in the future if you had more time.  What additional questions would you want to answer?  What additional data do you wish you had?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lessons and Challenges Slide- The last slide of your presentation should be entitled \"Lessons and Challenges\".  Discuss:  What was the toughest part of the project?  What lessons do you feel you learned?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Notes: \n",
    " * There isn't a limit to how many slides you can use, just the time limit indicated above.\n",
    " * There should NOT be code in your slides.\n",
    " * Be professional: No clunky or over wordy slides.\n",
    " * Dress in business casual.  So no jeans/t-shirts.\n",
    " * Those who simply read their presentations off the slides will lose points. Make eye contact with the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the presentations, alongside your fellow teammates, you will provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations.  \n",
